### Getting started

Before you can begin with the workshop, you must first install all dependencies. 
Afterwards you can start the initial version of the BreakOut game, without any TensorFlow.js dependencies. 
You can do this by executing the following commands in your terminal: 

````
npm install
npm start
````

This command should open the application using your default browser. 
Otherwise, just open ``http://localhost:4200``.


#### Notes:
* There are some issues with WebCam on Safari 12, so we recommend using Chrome or FireFox on MacOS.
* The application depends on [Parcel Bundler](https://parceljs.org/), so any changes on the source code will be visible after a refresh of your browser.

### Instructions

All instructions for the workshop can be found in the [docs](docs/instructions.md) directory.
